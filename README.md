# MyFIT

Android Studio (XML for front-end and Java) <br>
Nutritionix API (REST architecture, data parsed and handled in JSON) <br>
SQLite (embedded database within Android Studio to store User information and Food Logs) <br>

This is a simple demonstration of how the application works.

1. User is prompted to login <br>
2. If no account exists, user is taken to a register page where all necessary information is entered to calculate the BMR (Basal Metabollic Rate). <br>
3. User is taken to the main page where two options are shown: Progress and FoodLog. <br>
4. The Food Log allows users to add items through text, speech and scan (String query and UPC code are appended to the URL before making the HTTP call to the API, METHOD: "GET"). <br>
5. The Progress section allows users to see all nutrients added together through a progressive bar as well as their daily calorie intake. <br>
