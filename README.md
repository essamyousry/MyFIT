# MyFIT

Android Studio (XML for front-end and Java) <br>
Nutritionix API (REST architecture, data parsed and handled in JSON) <br>
SQLite (embedded database within Android Studio to store User information and Food Logs) <br>

This is a simple demonstration of how the application works.

1. User is prompted to login <br>
2. If no account exists a user is taken to a register page where all necessary information is entered to calculate the BMR (Basal Metabollic Rate). <br>
3. User is taken to the main page where two options exit: Progress and FoodLog. <br>
4. The Food Log allows users to add items through text, speech and scan (HTTP Call to Nutritionix API). <br>
5. The Progress section allows users to see all nutrients added together through a progressive bar as well as their daily calorie intake. <br>
